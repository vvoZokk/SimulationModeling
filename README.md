# Crossing Loop Simulation Modeling
It's small educational project.
### Objective
Railway between A and B stations is single-track with crossing loop C. Trains arrive on A and B stations every 45±10 min. Transit on the AC way lasts 15±3 min, transit on the BC way lasts 20±3 min.
Program simulates the employment of this railway.
